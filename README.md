# Arduino-RFID-Authentication
The goal of the RFID Authenication project is to create a simple to use Arduino sketch that can be used with RC522 card readers
and a centralized authentication server to enable users within a makerspace or similar facility to access equipment they are 
authorized to use.  The system will enable a relay to turn the equipment on and off at a set time period

The initial build is 
1. Arduino Uno
2. Ethernet Sheild
3. RC522 Reader
4. LED's 
5. Peizo 
6. LCD Screen
7. Relay
8. Current sensor
